I need someone's hand to lead me through the night
I need someone's arms to hold and squeeze me tight
When the night begins, baby I'm at an end
'Cause I need your love so bad

I need some lips to feel next to mine
Need someone to stand up to tell me when I'm lyin'
And when the lights are low and it's time to go
I need your love so bad

So now give it up and bring it home to me
Write it on a paper so it can be read to me
Tell me that you love me baby and stop drivin' me mad
Because I need your love so bad

Oh I need a soft voice that will talk to me at night
Don't you to worry, baby everything is gonna be alright
Please listen to my plea and bring it on home to me
Baby I need your love so bad

So give it up oh, and bring it on home to me
Alright write it on a paper baby so it can be read to me
Tell me that you love me and stop drivin' me mad
Because I need your love so bad

Oh I need a soft voice, baby that will talk to me at night
And don't you to worry, baby everything is gonna be alright
Please listen to my plea, bring it on home to me
Because I need your love so bad
Oh baby I need your love so bad
