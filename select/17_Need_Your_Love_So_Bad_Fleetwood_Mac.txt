Need someone's hand
To lead me through the night
I need someone's arms
To hold and squeeze me tight
Now, when the night begins
I'm at an end
Because I need your love so bad

I need some lips
To feel next to mine
I need someone to stand up
And tell me when I'm lyin'
And when the lights are low
And it's time to go
That's when I need your love so bad

So why don't you give it up
And bring it home to me
Or write it on a piece of paper, baby
So it can be read to me
Tell me that you love me
And stop driving me mad
Ooh, because I, I need your love so bad

Need your soft voice
To talk to me at night
I don't want you to worry, baby
I know we can make everything alright
Listen to my plea, baby
Bring it to me
Because I need your love so bad
