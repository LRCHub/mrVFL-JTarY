Every day, every word that I
say, lip service
I'm ok, I'll deny what's beneath
the surface
Without you here I don't know
what I'm doing
Can't hide my fears I try but
I'm in ruins
I could sit and lie to you
But what's the point, what's the
use
You can see I'm blind for you
You break the rules and I'm the
fool that wants you badly
No matter what you do
I still love you madly with your
every move
I want you so bad
Ba da da da, ba da da da, ba da
da da
I want you so bad
Ba da da da, ba da da da, ba da
da da
I want you so
Where do you go when you go, I
know I know
But I pretend I don't
Where do you go far from home,
you go you go
But still, I know
Without you here I don't know
what I'm doing
Can't hide my fears I try but
I'm in ruins
I could sit and lie to you
But what's the point, what's the
use
You can see I'm blind for you
You break the rules and I'm the
fool that wants you badly
No matter what you do
I still love you madly with your
every move
I want you so bad
Ba da da da, ba da da da, ba da
da da
I want you so bad
Ba da da da, ba da da da, ba da
da da
I want you so bad
Oh badly i pray the day is on
the way
when Saturday comes i leave u
I know the game
We love the play
You walk how far the leader
leader
I far the leader leader
Cause You’re my leader
No i want you badly
No matter what you do
I still love you madly with your
every move
I want you so bad
Ba da da da, ba da da da, ba da
da da
I want you so bad
Ba da da da, ba da da da, ba da
da da
I want you so bad
