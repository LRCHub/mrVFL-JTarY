When it hurts so bad, you got to let go
You can't let him know he's really gotten to ya
And it hurts so bad when you're all alone
Those ol' memories keep goin' through ya
And you wanna act nonchalant
But you can't, 'cause he keeps on haunting you

Oh, when it hurts so bad, gotta try and pretend
He's just a casual friend who never meant a thing to ya
Well you can fool your friends and you can laugh a lot
It's all a coverup of what he really means to ya
And you wanna act nonchalant
But you can't, 'cause he keeps on haunting you
Yes, and it hurts so bad

Oh, how can it hurt this bad when it was never planned?
But you stole my heart and here I am
I'm possessed by you, I'm obsessed with you
What I tryin' to say is I love you

Now how can I act nonchalant
When all I want is to spend the night with you?

Oh, and when it hurts this bad you gotta let go
Can't let him know he's really got to ya
And it hurts so bad when you're all alone
Those ol' memories keep going through ya

And it hurts so bad
Oh, I know it hurts so bad
Oh, and it hurts so bad
It hurts so bad
I know it hurts so bad
Yes, it hurts so bad
